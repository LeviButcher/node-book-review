# Project Overview

Book Review site made using Node JS, MongoDB, Express, and Pug

## The Goal

Take what I have learned from Wes Bos's Node JS course and created my own node js app.

### What a User should be able to do 

* Sign up, Log in, all that jazz
* Post a book review
  * Review contains Book title and review content and rating
* Comment on other users book reviews
* Comment on a comment (It'll never end)
* Search by Book to find reviews for that book
* Different queries for all time rated books, this months hot reviews, and worst rated books

### Potential Problems

MongoDB querying is weird and I forsee that being the biggest challange ahead.

## Result
I understand express, mongoose, mongodb, and promises much better. However, I didn't complete all the feature I wanted to make. Such as: 
* book querys- "this months hot reviews"
* comments

But everything else is done. I may come back to improve the UI or add more features but I think I'm ready to move onto a more intereseting project.
